# Introduction

**React Engineer Technical Assignment**

The test will require building 3 different screens:

1. **Screen 1 - Movie List View**: The movies list based on the following API: [https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-movie-details](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-movie-details)

   **Use Case:** _As a not logged user, I want to see a paginated list of the most [popular movies](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-popular-movies), so I can know the Title, Poster image, Release date and popularity of each movie._

2. **Screen 2 - Movie Details View**

   **Use Case 1:** _As a not logged user, I want to view details for a specific movie, so I can see more details than in the List view._

   **Use Case 2**: _As a logged user, on the movie detail view, I want to be able to [rate a movie](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/rate-movie), giving the movie a punctuation from 1 to 10._

3. **Screen 3 - Log In View**

   **Use Case:**  _As a not logged user,  I want to see a page, with a login form, so I became a logged in user ([API Auth pages](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/authentication/how-do-i-generate-a-session-id))_
